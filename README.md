Time Health ( Book Appointment for Stay Healthy )
## Getting Started

Time Health is a virtual Doctor appointment booking application, that has been developed to override the problems of booking an appointment with a doctor specially prevailing in the pandemic situation. This software is supported to eliminate the hardships faced by this existing manual booking system. No formal knowledge is needed for the user to use this system. Thus by this all it proves it is user-friendly. In this app we are showing the intaractive UI interface with dummy data  model to understand the basic flow. In this project we are using the clean architecture  with following folder breakup -> Parent folder - ( View, Bloc, Network ). We are using the modular approach for reduce the modular dependency between the each module of the project. Clean architecture also decouple the presentation layer and business layer.
